[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/nearley.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/nearley)

nearley is a simple, fast and powerful parsing toolkit. It consists of:

1. [A powerful, modular DSL for describing
   languages](https://nearley.js.org/docs/grammar)
2. [An efficient, lightweight Earley
   parser](https://nearley.js.org/docs/parser)
3. [Loads of tools, editor plug-ins, and other
   goodies!](https://nearley.js.org/docs/tooling)

nearley is a **streaming** parser with support for catching **errors**
gracefully and providing _all_ parsings for **ambiguous** grammars. It is
compatible with a variety of **lexers** (we recommend
[moo](http://github.com/tjvr/moo)). It comes with tools for creating **tests**,

Unlike most other parser generators, nearley can handle _any_ grammar you can
define in BNF (and more!). In particular, while most existing JS parsers such
as PEGjs and Jison choke on certain grammars (e.g. [left recursive
ones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion)), nearley handles them
easily and efficiently by using the [Earley parsing
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser).

nearley is used by a wide variety of projects:

- [artificial
  intelligence](https://github.com/ChalmersGU-AI-course/shrdlite-course-project)
  and
- [computational
  linguistics](https://wiki.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2014-15/W/6339/useful_handouts)
  classes at universities;
- [file format parsers](https://github.com/raymond-h/node-dmi);
- [data-driven markup languages](https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll-compiler);
- [compilers for real-world programming
  languages](https://github.com/sizigi/lp5562);
- and nearley itself! The nearley compiler is bootstrapped.

nearley is an npm [staff
pick](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-collection-staff-picks).

A big thanks to Nathan Dinsmore for teaching me how to Earley, Aria Stewart for
helping structure nearley into a mature module, and Robin Windels for
bootstrapping the grammar. Additionally, Jacob Edelman wrote an experimental
JavaScript parser with nearley and contributed ideas for EBNF support. Joshua
T. Corbin refactored the compiler to be much, much prettier. Bojidar Marinov
implemented postprocessors-in-other-languages. Shachar Itzhaky fixed a subtle
bug with nullables.
